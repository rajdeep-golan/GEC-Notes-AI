# GEC Notes

Use Google's Gemini to generate notes from any audio file or text transcription. Gec Notes (colloquial French for "too lazy") will transcribe any audio file using OpenAI's whisper library, and then pass it through Gemini to create notes, which you can copy-paste to other platforms.

## Usage

Edit a file called googleapikey.txt and place your gemini api token inside. then, 
run the app with `flask run`

OR

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask run
